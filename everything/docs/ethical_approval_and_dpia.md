# Ethical Approval and DPIA Guidelines for IADS

## Overview

This document outlines the ethical approval and Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) requirements for the Intrusion and Anomaly Detection System (IADS). These guidelines ensure compliance with university research ethics policy and GDPR requirements.

## Research Ethics Policy

### Types of Research Requiring Ethical Scrutiny

The following types of research must undergo ethical scrutiny and obtain formal approval:
- Research involving living human participants, their tissue, or their data
- Research with potential adverse environmental impact
- Research involving NHS patients, staff, or resources
- Research involving animals
- Research into terrorism, extremism, radicalization, and other areas under the counter-terrorism and security act (2015)

### Open Data & Data Management Principles

IADS supports:
- The principles of the UK Concordat on open research data
- Open access for research data and outputs
- Responsible data management practices

### Researcher Responsibilities

All researchers must:
1. Take responsible ownership of research data
2. Follow legal and regulatory compliance requirements
3. Ensure maximum security and confidentiality of research data
4. Protect personal, confidential, or sensitive data
5. Maintain data integrity
6. Ensure appropriate data availability

## GDPR and DPIA Requirements

### When is a DPIA Required?

A Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) is required when:
- Processing involves personal data
- There are potential privacy risks to individuals
- New technologies or methods are being implemented
- Processing could result in high risk to individuals' rights

### DPIA Process

1. **Identify Privacy Risks**
   - Document potential impacts on individual privacy
   - Assess likelihood and severity of risks
   - Consider technical and organizational measures

2. **Implement Safeguards**
   - Technical measures (e.g., encryption, anonymization)
   - Organizational policies and procedures
   - Access controls and data minimization

3. **Document and Review**
   - Record DPIA outcomes
   - Regular review and updates
   - Maintain documentation for compliance

## Data Management Guidelines

### Data Categories

1. **Anonymized Data**
   - No personal identifiers
   - Cannot be linked to individuals
   - Outside scope of data protection legislation

2. **Pseudoanonymized Data**
   - Uses participant codes
   - No direct personal information
   - Requires proper code management

3. **Non-anonymized Data**
   - Contains identifiable information
   - Requires strict protection measures
   - Must be justified if used

### Data Protection Measures

1. **Technical Safeguards**
   - Encryption of sensitive data
   - Secure storage systems
   - Access control mechanisms
   - Regular security updates

2. **Organizational Controls**
   - Staff training
   - Clear data handling procedures
   - Incident response plans
   - Regular compliance audits

## Implementation in IADS

### System Features

1. **Data Processing**
   - Implement data minimization
   - Use pseudonymization where possible
   - Secure storage of all data

2. **Access Control**
   - Role-based access
   - Audit logging
   - User authentication

3. **Security Measures**
   - Encryption of sensitive data
   - Secure communication channels
   - Regular security assessments

### Compliance Checklist

Before processing data:
- [ ] Determine if DPIA is needed
- [ ] Document data flow and purpose
- [ ] Implement appropriate security measures
- [ ] Ensure data minimization
- [ ] Set up audit trails
- [ ] Plan for data retention/deletion
