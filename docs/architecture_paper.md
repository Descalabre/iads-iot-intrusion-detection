# Architecture Paper: Intrusion and Anomaly Detection System (IADS) for IoT Devices

## Introduction
This document describes the architecture and design of a hybrid AI-based Intrusion and Anomaly Detection System (IADS) tailored for IoT devices deployed on Raspberry Pi platforms.

## System Architecture
The system combines two main components:
- **Rule-Based Detection:** Implements static rules and thresholds to detect simple anomalies.
- **AI-Based Detection:** Uses a deep learning model to identify complex intrusion patterns.

## Data Processing
- Data is collected from IoT sensors and devices.
- Preprocessing includes cleaning, normalization, and feature extraction.
- Features are engineered to capture relevant behavioral patterns.

## Hybrid Model
- The rule-based system acts as a first filter.
- Data flagged by rules is further analyzed by the AI model.
- The AI model is built using TensorFlow and optimized for Raspberry Pi deployment.

## Model Optimization
- Techniques such as quantization reduce model size and improve inference speed.
- TensorFlow Lite is used for model conversion.

## Testing and Validation
- Performance metrics include accuracy, false positive rate, and resource consumption.
- Testing is conducted in controlled environments simulating IoT network traffic.

## Security Considerations
- The system is designed to be resilient against adversarial attacks.
- Logging and monitoring help detect suspicious activities.

## Conclusion
This hybrid approach balances efficiency and accuracy, making it suitable for resource-constrained IoT devices.
